# pepper-wpyoutube
GDPR-compliant YouTube embedding tool for WordPress. It provides a simple shortcode like this: `[peppertube id="SXHMnicI6Pg"]`

## Features
- Privacy first YouTube embeds! Without ads, without any overbloat, just with a simple shortcode.
- Multilingual interface (`de_DE`, `de_DE_formal`, `en_US` so far)

## Planned features
- Better styling options. There is only the constant `PEPPERYOUTUBE_LOAD_CSS` to load or not to load the default stylesheet so far.
- Maybe a TTL for the thumbnails in the cache.
- Maybe a more flexible interpreting of the attribute in the shortcode, especially an possibility to pass the full URI, not only an ID. This could be more comfortable.
- Maybe an optimization of the code, rewritten in a class.
- An option to save the consent in a cookie.

There is no ETA or even a periodic development, but the plugin will grow with my wordpress projects.
